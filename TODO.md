# TODO

- fix highlight when logging in to new account
- warn about no E2E room shared if no devices
- Make HTile enter key trigger leftClicked()

## Refactoring

- General change/upload avatar component for account and room settings
- Reorder QML object declarations,
  conform to https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/qml-codingconventions.html

## Issues

- Replying to one of our own message that's currently only a local echo
  results in a reply to an empty ID

- Bottom focus line for an `HTextArea` inside a `ScrollView` is invisible,
  put the background on `ScrollView` instead?

- Don't send typing notification when switching to a room where the composer 
  has preloaded text 

- When calling `Backend.update_room_read_marker()` for a recent message,
  the marker will only be updated for accounts that have already received
  it (server lag) 

- Jumping between accounts (clicking in account bar or alt+(Shift+)N) is
  laggy with hundreds of rooms in between
- On startup, if a room's last event is a membership change,
  it won't be visible in timeline no matter what the user config is
- There are rooms without messages to show as last message subtitle after
  initial sync

- Drag-scrolling in room pane a tiny bit activates the delegates

- Catch server 5xx errors when sending message and retry 

- Handle cases where a known account's access token is invalid
- If an account is gone from the user's config, discard UI state last page

- After forgetting a room, it comes back because of the "you left" event

- `code`, mentions and links in quote ("> http://example.com") aren't properly
  colored in room delegate "last message" subtitle

- `Timer` and `Animation` are bound to framerate
- Can't use `QQmlApplicationEngine`, problem with QApplication?
  See https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-50992
- [HTML <hr> not rendered](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-74342)
- Pausing uploads doesn't work well, servers ends up dropping the connection 
  (no real solution possible?)

## Interface

- Show scrollbars for a few seconds if there's content to scroll on when 
  opening a page or popup
- Device list keyboard navigation
- Device IP geolocation
- Can rooms but left with a reason?

- When responding to a message, highlight that message in the timeline
- Highlight timeline messages that mentions our user
- Add room members loading indicator, similar to the "Loading past messages..."

- Long-press-drag to select multiple messages on touch
- Drag to select multiple messages on non-touch

- Make clicking on user/room mentions open relevant UI instead of matrix.to
  URL in browser

- Missing room settings:
  - Set whether to publish this room in the server room directory
  - Set history visibility
  - Set aliases 
  - Change members power level
  - Setup permissions 
  - Unban members
  - Set flair (which community this room belongs to)

- Linkify URLs in topic text areas

- Expand the room pane if it's currently too small to show room settings
- Use a loader for items not in view for the `HTabContainer`'s `SwipeView`

- Make "Cancel" buttons consistent, and able to cancel running Backend
  coroutines. Set `disabledWhileLoading` to `false` for all "OK" buttons where
  it makes sense.

- Remember the previously focused item in page for ctrl+tab 
- https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-smoothedanimation.html for progress bars
- Improve when HDrawer should collapse when the ui is zoomed
- Make room invite/left banner buttons look better

- Choose a better easing types for animations
- Make HListView scrollbars more visible
- In messages, remove the HTML lists excess left margin
- Improve UI for very small window heights

- In room creation, click avatar to set the future room's avatar
- In join room page, show the matching room's avatar when typing
- In direct chat page, show the matching user's avatar when typing

- Combine events so they take less space
  - After combining is implemented,
    no need to hide profile changes by default anymore

- Animate `DayBreak` apparition

- Device settings
- Proparly formatted rich replies
- Messages editing
- Code highlighting
- Adapt shortcuts flicking speed to font size 

- Accept drag and drop to upload files or set a new avatar 
- Improve room tooltips, e.g. show last messages
- Warn user when connection is lost or 429s happen
- "Rejoin" LeftBanner button if room is public
- Daybreak color
- Conversation breaks: show time of first new msg after break instead of big
  blank space

- `MainPane`:
  - Animate when logging out last account and sidepane turns invisible

- Server selection
- Implement Register/Reset pages

- Theming
  - Use a standard file format
  - icons.preferredPack: accept multiple values
  - Find icon packs in user data dir
  - See [Text.fontSizeMode](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-text.html#fontSizeMode-prop)

- Settings page
- Notifications
- Opening files with keyboard
- Better `<pre>` 

- Replace the rubbish default filepicker on Linux

- Show confirmation box when picking file to upload or uploading from clipboard
- Show proper progress ring for mxc thumbnails loading

- Sentinel function to report local file paths for already downloaded media,
  without having to click and try downloading first

  - Special UI for matrix.to URLs

- Prevent using upload keybindings in rooms where user doesn't have permission
  to upload

## Backend

- Use new nio `AsyncClient.restore_login()`

- Better config file format

- Prevent starting multiple client instances, causes problems with E2E DB
- Check if username exists on login screen

  - Cross-signing

- Status message and presence
- Display read receipts on events (who/how many people have read an event)

## Notable changes for future Qt version upgrade

### [Qt 5.13](https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_5.13)

- Added `SplitView`
- Added `cache` property to icon

### [Qt 5.14](https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_5.14)

- Applications can now opt-in to use non-integer scale factors.
  Use `QGuiApplication::highDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy`.

- Added `qmlRegisterSingletonInstance` function.
  This allows to expose a QObject as a singleton to QML, without having to
  create a factory function as required by `qmlRegisterSingletonType`.
  It is meant as a type safe replacement of `setContextProperty`.

- Added `qmlRegisterAnonymousType` as a replacement for `qmlRegisterType`.
  It allows to specify the URI and major version for better tooling support.

- qmllint gained an experimental -U option. If run with it, it warns about 
  about accesses to unqualified identifiers

- `Text` and `TextEdit` now support Markdown format
  (CommonMark and GitHub dialects) as an alternative to HTML.
  Includes the GitHub checklist extension, such that you can click to toggle
  checkboxes in a `TextEdit`.

- `TextEdit` uses an I-beam cursor by default, and a pointing-hand cursor when
  hovering a checkbox or a link

- Added `WheelHandler`, an Event Handler for the mouse wheel, and optionally
  for emulated mouse wheel events coming from a trackpad.
  - Rewrite `HKineticScrollingDisabler` with it 

- Added `BoundaryRule` in Qt.labs.animation: a `PropertyValueInterceptor` that
  restricts the range of values a numeric property can have, applies
  "resistance" when the value is overshooting, and provides the ability to
  animate it back within range. It's particularly useful in combination with
  `WheelHandler`, to provide similar physics as Flickable has.

- `Image` and `BorderImage` now have the same `currentFrame` and `frameCount`
  properties that `AnimatedImage` has; this allows choosing an individual icon
  from an .ICO file that contains multiple icons, for example.
  In the future it's intended to support other multi-page formats such as
  PDF, TIFF and WEBP.

- `Binding.restoreMode`: This property can be used to describe if and how the
  original value should be restored when the binding is disabled.

### [Qt 5.15](https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_5.15)

- Introduced inline components
  (ability to declare multiple QML components in the same file)

- Introduced `required` properties

- Added a declarative way of registering types to QML

- Added support for the Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)

- Added `qmlformat` tool which automatically formats any QML file according to
  the QML Coding Conventions.

- Added `cursorShape` property to pointer handlers. Most pointer handlers
  (e.g. `DragHandler`) will change the cursor when the active state is true.
  `HoverHandler` will change it when the mouse is hovering over the `Item` that
  contains the `HoverHandler`.

- Added `selectTextByMouse` property to `ComboBox`.

- Technology Preview: Support for running Qt Quick (2D) on top of 
  Direct3D, Metal and Vulkan
