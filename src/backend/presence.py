    """Represents a single matrix user's presence fields.

    These objects are stored in `Backend.presences`, indexed by user ID.
    It must only be instanced when receiving a `PresenceEvent` or
    registering an `Account` model item.

    When receiving a `PresenceEvent`, we get or create a `Presence` object in
    `Backend.presences` for the targeted user. If the user is registered in any
    room, add its `Member` model item to `members`. Finally, update every
    `Member` presence fields inside `members`.

    When a room member is registered, we try to find a `Presence` in
    `Backend.presences` for that user ID. If found, the `Member` item is added
    to `members`.

    When an Account model is registered, we create a `Presence` in
    `Backend.presences` for the accountu's user ID whether the server supports
    presence or not (we cannot know yet at this point),
    and assign that `Account` to the `Presence.account` field.

    Special attributes:
        members: A `{room_id: Member}` dict for storing room members related to
            this `Presence`. As each room has its own `Member`s objects, we
            have to keep track of their presence fields. `Member`s are indexed
            by room ID.

        account: `Account` related to this `Presence`, if any. Should be
            assigned when client starts (`MatrixClient._start()`) and
            cleared when client stops (`MatrixClient._start()`).
